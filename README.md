# rust-fizzbuzz
rust-fizzbuzz is a simple and *very* basic fizz buzz implementation in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

The logic is as follows:
* For each number in a range from 1 to 100:
* If the number is divisible by 3, write `fizz`
* If the number is dibisible by 5, write `buzz`
* If the number is divisible by both, write `fizzbuzz`
